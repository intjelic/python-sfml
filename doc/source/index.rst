Python bindings for SFML
========================
This is version |version| of the Python bindings for `SFML`_, based on
SFML |version|, and is made available under the terms of the `zlib/libpng`_ license.

By combining the strength of SFML with the ease of the Python language,
we can provide an amazing tool to quickly build multimedia software.
